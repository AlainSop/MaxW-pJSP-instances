The generation of MaxW constraints is driven by a global target off-shift density $\mathcal{D}$, which represents the wanted proportion of rest days required for each operator over the full scheduling horizon $\mathcal{H}$. These rest days are distributed over several randomly generated time intervals, subject to practical constraints: each interval has a minimum length of 3 days and a maximum length of $0.2 \times \mathcal{H}$. For each interval, the maximal numbers of work days are defined through local density parameter $d$, which specify the allowed proportion of rest days within the interval. This density is sampled using Gaussian distributions $\mathcal{N}(d, d/4)$, introducing variability in both the timing and duration of rest periods. MaxW constraints are generated for each operator until the total minimum number of required rest days reaches the global target.
